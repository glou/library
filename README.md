#Library project

Implementation of a "small Library app", following JavaScript track from The Odin Project.
I expect this is going to be very challenging, since it's the first project covering OOP; but 
I'm also excited to learn and apply more in-depth concepts and tools.

- September 11, 2021: created the repository and initial file structure.
