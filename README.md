# Library project


Implementation of a "small Library app", following JavaScript track from The Odin Project.
I expect this is going to be very challenging, since it's the first project covering OOP; but 
I'm also excited to learn and apply more in-depth concepts and tools.

- October 22, 2021: Already did most of the functionalities. No styling yet. After some long googling,
I finally managed to make a working slider without rebuilding the entire display, and I feel the trying
and researching were very satisfactory.
- September 11, 2021: created the repository and initial file structure.
